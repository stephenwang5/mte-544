## Part 1 and 2: No marks
## Part 3: 40 marks
**From Code Submission on LEARN:**
- ```10 marks``` for the proper modification of the EKF, ```5/10``` for incomplete/partially wrong implementation, ```0/10``` for missing/entirely wrong implementation.
- ```5 marks``` for complete and correct/proper comments added to the KF algorithm code in ```kalman_filter.py```, ```3/5``` for incomplete and/or partially wrong comments, ```0/5``` for missing and/or completely wrong comments.
- ```5 marks``` for correct subscription to the necessary messages, ```2.5/5``` for incomplete/partially wrong implementation, ```0/5``` for missing/entirely wrong implementation.
- ```10 marks``` for the correct/proper derivation of the matrices and functions in ```localization.py```,  ```5/10``` for incomplete/partially wrong matrices and functions, ```0/10``` for missing/entirely wrong matrices and functions.
- ```10 marks``` for the correct/proper completion of the ```fusion_callback``` function, ```5/10``` for incomplete/partially wrong implementation, ```0/10``` for missing/entirely wrong implementation.

## Part 4: 20 marks
**From Code and Report Submission on LEARN**
- ```10 marks``` for completing the data logging (have the logged files) for the point planner and the spiral motion, ```5/10``` for completing only one of the two/partially complete, ```0/10``` incomplete.

**In-Lab**
- ```10 marks``` for showing the EKF results of the point planner and spiral (```5``` points each motion), ```5/10``` if not shown but it's in the report (```2.5``` points each motion), ```0/10``` if not completed.

## Conclusion - Report: 40 marks
**From Report on LEARN**
- ```1``` mark for names (Family Name, First Name); student IDs of all group members; station number (if known); and robot number.
- ```10 marks``` for describing your understanding of the EKF algorithm implemented, ```5/10``` for incomplete/insufficient explanation, ```0/10``` for missing explanation.
- ```10 marks``` for the derivation of equations and matrices for the EKF, ```5/10``` if partially wrong/incomplete derivation, ```0/10``` if missing/entirely wrong derivation.
- ```10 marks``` for reporting results of the EKF with at least 2 different variations on Q and two on R, ```5/10``` for only one each (or varied only Q or R), ```0/10``` for none. The results should contain at least your estimated states and the measurements (on the same plot for comparison). There is a deduction of ```1``` mark for each figure missing title, label, legend (when needed), and grid.
- ```9 marks``` for discussion on the results obtained, ```5/9``` for incomplete/insufficient discussion, ```0/9``` for missing discussion.
- Deduction of ```1``` mark for each page exceeding the limit.
